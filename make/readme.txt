METIS v1.1.0

1. Clicking the icon on Windows or macOS
2. Run on command without input arguments

It is note that METIS needs two files; geometry file and 'seq.txt' files
	2.1. Gemetry file
		The user can choose pre-defined target geometry when running METIS. Also,
		the user can use the target geometry file (GEO, PLY, or SVG format) that
		should be located at the folder named "input".
	2.2. Scaffod sequence file
		The sequence data file named as "seq.txt" should be located at the same
		folder where METIS.exe exists. If there is no file 'seq.txt', the m13mp18
		sequence is used. To use user's defined sequence, write 'user' at the first
		row in the 'seq.txt' file and write scaffold sequences in the second row.

3. Run on command with 9 input arguments:

		METIS [output path] [geometry file] [sequence file] [edge-section] [vertex design] [edge] [edge length] [mesh spacing] [run mode]
		ex) METIS   .\outputs   test.ply   seq.txt   3   1   42   0.0   s

	para 1 - Output path for output files generated by designer
		For Windows - Directory path with "\", ex) ..\output
		For macOS   - Directory path with "/", ex) ../output

	para 2 - Goemetry file name including the path
		integer  - METIS uses the pre-defined geometry
		filename - METIS reads the user's geometry file

	para 3 - Scaffold sequence file name including the path
		seq.txt - Scaffold sequence file that user submits
		m13     - M13 scaffold sequence used without user scaffold sequence file

	para 4 - Edge section (METIS always uses 3)
		1 - DX
		2 - 6HB (inner)
		3 - 6HB (middle)

	para 5 - Vertex design (METIS always uses 2)
		1 - Flat vertex
		2 - Mitered vertex

	para 6 - Edge number - always 2 for all desingers

	para 7 - Edge length
		integer - Over 37

	para 8 - Mesh spacing parameter only for PERDIX
		0.0 - 1.0 - The mesh density will be defined with this option when using boundary only design

	para 9 - Run mode
		s - Single run: Design files are generated in the folder named 'path_output'
		m - Multiple run: Design files are generated in the folder names 'path_output/design_name'
	
4. Examples of running METIS with input arguments

	For Windows
		METIS.exe output 2D_1.ply seq.txt 3 2 0 42 0.0 s > METIS.log 2>&1
	For Mac
		./METIS ./output 2D_1.ply seq.txt 3 2 0 63 0.0 s > METIS.log 2>&1
